Repo for music analysis using ML



# TODO
## Ideas
- Melodic richness
- Rythmic richness
- Composition richness (jazz vs today's songs = repetitions in the song)
- Circle of fifth transitions
- Intro/Outro scoring
- Save precomputed data as file (pickle for ex)
- Vocal scoring
- Genre scoring
- Mood scoring (dancing, chilling, intensity for techno)
- Absolute quality scoring (to rank and select songs)
- Sequence optimization
- Neural Networks / Transformers for spectrogram and audio data

## Transitions = Magic shuffle
- Sequence optimization
- Rythmic proximity
- Harmonic proximity
- DTW to find close rythms or melodies with flexible distances
- Intro/Outro scoring
- Breaks (link to a surprise parameter)
- Structure & momentum in the set
- Parameters
  - Mood
  - N songs
  - Surprise


## Smart Fader
- DJ-GAN to generate transitions
